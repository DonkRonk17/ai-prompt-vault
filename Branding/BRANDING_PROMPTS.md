## 1. Title Card (16:9 Landscape - 1920x1080)

```
Create a professional title card for "AI Prompt Vault" - a developer tool for managing AI prompts.

Style: Dark navy blue background (#0a0e27) with bright cyan accents (#00d4ff). Modern, tech-forward, minimalist design.

Visual elements:
- Central focus: A stylized vault/safe icon made of geometric shapes
- The vault should be slightly open, with bright cyan light emanating from inside
- Floating around the vault: Small geometric representations of "prompts" (speech bubbles, document icons, code brackets)
- These elements should have a subtle glow effect in cyan
- Background: Deep navy with subtle circuit board pattern or neural network nodes (very faint)

Typography:
- "AI PROMPT VAULT" in bold, modern sans-serif font
- Positioned below or overlaid on the vault icon
- Color: Bright cyan (#00d4ff) with subtle glow
- Tagline underneath: "Save, organize, reuse" in lighter cyan

Technical feel: Include subtle hex code elements, binary patterns, or terminal-style text in the background (very faint, don't overpower main elements)

Overall mood: Professional, trustworthy, innovative, developer-focused
Composition: Centered, balanced, clean
No humans, no photos, pure geometric/abstract design
```

## 2. Logo Mark (1:1 Square - 1024x1024)

```
Create a logo mark for "AI Prompt Vault" that works as a standalone icon.

Style: Dark navy background (#0a0e27) with bright cyan (#00d4ff) as primary color. Geometric, minimal, instantly recognizable.

Design concept:
- A geometric vault/safe symbol
- Simplified, iconic version - should work at small sizes
- The vault is stylized with clean lines and sharp angles
- Central element: A keyhole or lock mechanism in the center
- Surrounding the vault: 3-4 small geometric "prompt" symbols (speech bubble outlines, brackets, or document corners)
- These orbit the vault or connect to it with thin cyan lines
- The whole design should fit in a circular or rounded square boundary

Color palette:
- Background: Deep navy (#0a0e27)
- Primary icon: Bright cyan (#00d4ff)
- Highlights: White or lighter cyan for key details
- Optional: Very subtle gradient from darker cyan to bright cyan

Style guidelines:
- Clean, vector-ready design
- Strong silhouette that reads well in black and white
- Works at 32x32 pixels and scales up beautifully
- Professional, not playful
- Tech-forward, developer tool aesthetic

No text, no humans, pure icon design
Should be recognizable as a "vault" + "AI/prompts" concept
```

## 3. Horizontal Logo (3:1 Wide - 1500x500)

```
Create a horizontal logo for "AI Prompt Vault" combining icon and text.

Layout: Icon on left, text on right, designed for headers and banners.

Icon (left third):
- Simplified vault symbol from the logo mark
- Geometric, clean lines
- Bright cyan (#00d4ff) on dark navy (#0a0e27)
- Should be recognizable even when small

Text (right two-thirds):
- "AI PROMPT VAULT" in bold, modern sans-serif
- Two-line option: "AI PROMPT" on top, "VAULT" below
- Or single line with small tagline underneath
- Color: Bright cyan (#00d4ff) with subtle glow
- Tagline (optional, smaller): "Developer Prompt Manager" in light gray

Background:
- Dark navy (#0a0e27) with very subtle tech pattern
- OR transparent background with just the elements

Style:
- Professional, clean, technical
- Easily readable at various sizes
- Works on dark backgrounds (primary) and light backgrounds (inverted version)
- Spacing: Comfortable padding around elements

Use case: GitHub header, website banner, documentation header
Aspect ratio: 3:1 (wide)
Professional developer tool aesthetic
```

## 4. App Icon (1:1 Simplified - 512x512)

```
Create a simplified app icon for "AI Prompt Vault" optimized for small sizes.

Requirements:
- Must be instantly recognizable at 32x32 pixels
- Should work on various backgrounds (provide with dark navy background)
- Maximum 3-4 visual elements
- High contrast, bold shapes

Design approach:
- Central element: Simplified vault/lock symbol
- Geometric, minimal design
- Use only 2-3 colors: navy background (#0a0e27), bright cyan (#00d4ff), white for highlights
- ONE key visual element that represents "prompt vault": Perhaps a vault door slightly ajar with light coming out, or a lock with a speech bubble integrated

Style:
- Flat or very subtle depth (no complex shadows/3D)
- Bold, thick lines
- High contrast
- Geometric shapes (circles, squares, triangles combined)
- Clean silhouette

Icon should communicate:
- Security/vault concept
- AI/prompt content inside
- Professional, trustworthy feel

Avoid:
- Too much detail (won't scale down)
- Thin lines (won't be visible at small sizes)
- Complex gradients
- Multiple small elements

Perfect for: macOS dock, Windows taskbar, mobile app icon, favicon
Size: 512x512 with elements that remain clear at 32x32
